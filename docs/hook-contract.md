# Hook Contract

This document is the single source of truth for Hook event, response, state, approval, runner, and cleanup behavior. `README.md` and `docs/configuration.md` provide deployment summaries and link back here; test ownership is recorded in [`tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md).

The audited upstream behavior baseline is recorded in [upstream-v0.2.8-parity.md](upstream-v0.2.8-parity.md).

## Events

The plugin declares handlers for:

- `UserPromptSubmit`
- `PreToolUse`
- `PermissionRequest`
- `PostToolUse`
- `SubagentStart`
- `SubagentStop`
- `PreCompact`
- `Stop`

Tool matchers currently include `Bash`, `exec_command`, nested `*__exec_command` names, `apply_patch`, `Edit`, `Write`, and `mcp__.*`; `PostToolUse` additionally includes `Read` for bounded local-source output checks. Host naming is version-specific. A tool omitted by the host or matcher receives no protection from this plugin. Matcher expansion changes the Hook trust hash and should be reviewed before trust is accepted again.

Each command handler declares a POSIX `command` and a PowerShell `commandWindows`. Both resolve the script from host-provided `PLUGIN_ROOT`; Windows additionally requires host-provided `PLUGIN_DATA`. Windows 原生入口兼容 PowerShell 5.1/7，只读取 `PLUGIN_DATA/runtime.json`，并在同一个固定 Python 3.12 子进程中完成版本验证和 Hook 执行；不会从 `PATH` 发现或回退解释器。`.cmd` 仅作为兼容入口。Hook stdin is decoded as strict UTF-8 and stdout is emitted as ASCII-safe JSON.

## Failure behavior

- Invalid JSON blocks.
- Invalid UTF-8 blocks.
- Internal validation errors block stateful events.
- Corrupt, unreadable, unsupported-schema, symlinked, or reparse-point state blocks and is not silently replaced.
- Missing `session_id` blocks stateful events.
- Unknown event names return an empty response because the plugin has no declared policy for them.
- Hook timeout behavior belongs to the host and must be verified for each supported Codex version.
- Windows 缺少 `PLUGIN_DATA` 或 `runtime.json` 时返回 `127`；清单、固定路径、reparse point、启动或 Python 版本无效时返回 `126`；Hook 自身退出码原样返回。

- Each dispatched event opens one shared six-second decision deadline. Classification-time Git children and state-lock waits draw from that budget, and an exhausted budget is treated as an unestablished answer, so the affected check fails closed. Ordinary Hook dispatch never starts a cleanup process. Approved-Git runner startup detaches the best-effort cleanup worker before its deliberate security rechecks, which remain outside the event decision deadline. A user-scoped lock in the system temporary directory establishes nonblocking single-flight before plugin-data validation, and a persisted cursor advances the active window across stable directory listings. Each run admits at most 64 directory candidates into that window, attempts at most two directory removals, caps each removal child at 500 ms, and applies a one-second cleanup deadline after candidate enumeration yields control. Portable Python APIs cannot preempt a blocked filesystem enumeration, so arbitrary-backlog traversal time and eventual cleanup are not hard guarantees. Live runner leases continue to protect active artifacts. The deadline and event-local Git read cache are cleared on both normal and exceptional dispatch exits.
- Repeated remote and config reads within one event are answered once. Reads that exist to detect drift, including every runner-side revalidation, are never served from that cache.

## Approval binding

When experimental natural-language approvals are enabled, a dangerous command grant is bound to:

- session and current turn,
- canonical working directory,
- normalized command hash,
- detected risk code,
- exact `tool_use_id` and tool name across `PreToolUse` and `PermissionRequest`.

The grant is consumed once. Replays, changed arguments, changed working directories, changed tool names, changed tool IDs, and cross-turn use are denied by the protocol tests.

Scoped Git/GitHub transaction grants are a separate policy opt-in and also require natural-language approvals. Positive authorization clauses are parsed independently from trailing safety exclusions. Exact `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands bind their command digests to the matching repository scope, branch, remote target, and canonical `origin` push-URL identity. A single existing repository may infer its target from one safe canonical `origin`; multi-repository source-to-target mappings are never inferred by list position. Helper, local, insecure, bulk, recursive, multi-ref, custom receive-pack, unresolved scope override, multi-scope, and multi-target forms fail closed.

An unfinished publication transaction can continue in a later prompt only when that prompt contains a fresh approval anchor and explicitly asks to continue the previously authorized Git, GitHub, or publication transaction. Continuation updates only the active turn. The original session, authorization working directory, issue time, 30-minute TTL, bindings, operation set, pending reservations, and consumed-operation ledger remain unchanged. `PreToolUse` reserves one immutable in-flight `tool_use_id` and rewrites the exact command to a one-time private runner carrying its validated host data-directory path. Matching `PermissionRequest` requires the matching unclaimed private ticket and revalidates the session, turn, tool-use ID, execution options, scope, command digest, and transaction binding; altered runner-shaped retries revoke that transaction. A push ticket additionally carries one safe credential-free URL and a source snapshot containing the resolved local branch, commit OID, object format, and object database. The runner revalidates this binding and pushes the immutable OID from a private bare repository. Its frozen system/global config snapshot retains credential and HTTP settings while dropping URL rewrites; repository-local config and hooks are excluded. Upstream metadata is written only for a verified local branch after remote success and remote revalidation. The receipt records remote success separately so the push operation is consumed even if the later local upstream write fails. Other nonzero, missing, claimed, expired, replayed, malformed, or mismatched tickets or receipts revoke the transaction and all matching pending reservations and runner records. Exact operations that cannot produce a supported command digest fail closed, and heterogeneous per-repository bindings retire only their own declared operations. The host `Stop` event preserves an unfinished transaction or pending transaction reservation. A generic approval or continuation, a different session or authorization working directory, an expired or completed grant, a pending single-command grant, or any scope, target, remote, branch, visibility, or force-mode change clears the transaction grant.

Windows transaction rewriting has a narrow PowerShell contract: the default native route and explicit `powershell(.exe)` or `pwsh(.exe)` overrides are accepted; explicit `cmd(.exe)`, Bash, and `sh` overrides are denied before reservation. This restriction applies only to the one-time scoped transaction runner.

The constrained GitHub HTTPS clone lane is independently disabled by default. When enabled, its shallow no-checkout form remains the only automatic read-only lane. A full GitHub HTTPS clone can run only when the exact direct command was positively authorized. Both forms require a new absolute workspace destination, exact local tool identity and tool-use ID, trusted resolved Git executable, default execution options, and provenance reservation. The Hook records the checkout after matching `PostToolUse`; later mutation requires an exact preauthorized command hash, including when `clone` and `switch -c` were declared together before the destination existed.

Sensitive-disclosure grants are separately disabled by default. When enabled, a grant is bound to the current turn, one recognized target derived from an exact trusted MCP server ID or host multiplexer operation prefix, and hashes of configured data terms. Grant-term matching uses identifier boundaries and excludes term-specific negations. Every concrete configured term in the outbound payload, including a non-empty nested object or list, must be included in that grant. Unknown MCP servers remain external and cannot claim a named target through payload text or a lookalike namespace. The grant is consumed on first matching use.

## Local redaction

The Hook treats only two edit surfaces as eligible for the local-redaction exception:

- `apply_patch`: removed lines are compared with added lines.
- structured `Edit`: `old_string` is compared with `new_string`.

The exception applies when removed content contains a detected secret or concrete configured value and newly persisted content no longer does. `Write`, external tools, and additions that retain a detected value remain blocked.
